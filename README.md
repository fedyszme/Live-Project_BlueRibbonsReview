# Live-Project_BlueRibbonsReview
Live project with Prosper IT, working with a team of 8 other developer to develop new features and functionality for an ASP.NET MVC application using Entity Framework. Due to confidentiality I am unable to post the entire project but do have permission to post some of the individual files, code snippets and screen shots.

Blue Ribbons Review is website where users can either sell or buy items at a discount. The users register their accounts, and can be sellers or both buyers and sellers.

I worked with the Admin Controller, AdminViewModel, and Views. I created the logic for the edit, details, delete action results and created the corresponding views while altering the index. 

I created a link in the Admin Index View that creates a CSV file with the emails of the users. This utilized StringWrither to do so.
